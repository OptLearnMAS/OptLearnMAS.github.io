								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							Stimulated by various emerging applications involving agents to solve complex problems in
							real-world domains, such as intelligent sensing systems for the Internet of the Things (IoT),
							automated configurators for critical infrastructure networks, and intelligent resource allocation for
							social domains (e.g., security games for the deployment of security resources or
							auctions/procurements for allocating goods and services), agents in these domains commonly
							leverage different forms optimization and/or learning to solve complex problems.
							<br>
							The goal of the workshop is to provide researchers with a venue to discuss models or techniques for
							tackling a variety of multi-agent optimization problems. We seek contributions in the general area of
							multi-agent optimization, including distributed optimization, coalition formation, optimization
							under uncertainty, winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements, and algorithms
							to compute Nash and other equilibria in games. Of particular emphasis are contributions at the
							intersection of optimization and learning.
							See below for a (non-exhaustive) list of topics.
							</p>
							<p>
							This workshop invites works from different strands of the multi-agent systems community that
							pertain to the design of algorithms, models, and techniques to deal with multi-agent optimization
							and learning problems or problems that can be effectively solved by adopting a multi-agent
							framework.
							</p>
							<h3>Topics</h3>
							The workshop organizers invite paper submissions on the following (and related) topics:
							<ul>
								<li>Optimization for learning (strategic and non-strategic) agents</li>
								<li>Learning for multi-agent optimization problems</li>
								<li>Distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization</li>
								<li>Winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements</li>
								<li>Coalition or group formation algorithms</li>
								<li>Algorithms to compute Nash and other equilibria in games</li>
								<li>Optimization under uncertainty</li>
								<li>Optimization with incomplete or dynamic input data</li>
								<li>Algorithms for real-time applications</li>
								<li>Cloud, distributed and grid computing</li>
								<li>Applications of learning and optimization in societally beneficial domains</li>
								<li>Multi-agent planning</li>
								<li>Multi-robot coordination</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The workshop is of interest both to researchers investigating applications of multi-agent systems to optimization problems in large, complex domains, as well as to those examining optimization and learning problems that arise in systems comprised of many autonomous agents. In so doing, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to discuss common issues that arise in solving optimization and learning problems in different areas, to introduce new application domains for multi-agent optimization techniques, and to elaborate common benchmarks to test solutions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of benchmarks and data sets 
								that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in 
								machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
							</p>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> The workshop will be a one-day 
							meeting.  It will include a number of  technical  
							sessions, a poster session where presenters can discuss their work, with
							the aim of  further fostering collaborations, multiple invited
							speakers covering crucial challenges for the field of
							multiagent optimization and learning.</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

									<h3>Towards Learned Cooperation at Scale in Robotic Multi-Agent Systems</h3>
								</header>
								Guillaume Sartoretti, National University of Singapore
								<br>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong>
								<br>	
								With the recent advances in sensing, actuation, computation, and communication, the deployment of large numbers of robots is becoming a promising avenue to enable or speed up complex tasks in areas such as manufacturing, last-mile delivery, search-and-rescue, or autonomous inspection. My group strives to push the boundaries of multi-agent scalability by understanding and eliciting emergent coordination/cooperation in multi-robot systems as well as in articulated robots (where agents are individual joints). Our work mainly relies on distributed (multi-agent) reinforcement learning, where we focus on endowing agents with novel information and mechanisms that can help them align their decentralized policies towards team-level cooperation. In this talk, I will first summarize my early work in independent learning, before discussing my group's recent advances in convention, communication, and context-based learning. I will discuss these techniques within a wide variety of robotic applications, such as multi-agent path finding, autonomous exploration/search, task allocation, and legged locomotion. Finally, I will also touch on our recent incursion into the next frontier for multi-robot systems: cooperation learning for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. Throughout this journey, I will highlight the key challenges surrounding learning representations, policy space exploration, and scalability of the learned policies, and outline some of the open avenues for research in this exciting area of robotics.

								Guillaume Sartoretti joined the Mechanical Engineering Department at the National University of Singapore (NUS) as an Assistant Professor in 2019, where he founded the Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) lab. Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (USA), where he worked with Prof. Howie Choset. He received his Ph.D. in robotics from EPFL (Switzerland) in 2016 for his dissertation on "Control of Agent Swarms in Random Environments," under the supervision of Prof. Max-Olivier Hongler. His passion and research lie in understanding and eliciting emergent coordination/cooperation in large multi-agent systems, by identifying what information and mechanisms can help agents reason about their individual role/contribution to each other and to the team. Guillaume was a Manufacturing Futures Initiative (MFI) postdoctoral fellow at CMU in 2018-2019, was awarded an Amazon Research Awards in 2022, as well as an Outstanding Early Career Award from NUS' College of Design and Engineering in 2023.

									<h3>Towards a Unified Theory of Learning in Games: Chaos, Anarchy, Regret & Equilibration </h3>
								</header>
								Georgios Piliouras, Google DeepMind 
								<br>
								<strong>Abstract:</strong>
								<br>	
								We examine some classic questions in game theory and online learning. How do standard online optimization, regret-minimizing dynamics such as multiplicative weights update, online gradient descent, and follow-the-regularized-leader (and variants thereof) behave when applied in games? 
								The standard textbook answer to this question is that these dynamics converge in a time-average sense to weak notions of equilibria. We discuss weaknesses of such results in practice and turn our focus towards understanding the day-to-day behavior instead. 
								In the seminal class of zero-sum games, continuous-time dynamics ``cycle" around the equilibrium, whereas discrete time-algorithms can behave in all possible ways (equilibration, recurrence/cycles, or unstable chaos) based only on minor changes. 
								In the standard class of potential/congestion games, such dynamics experience phase transitions from stability to chaos as the total system demand increases. Such instabilities lead to high social inefficiency even in games where the Price of Anarchy is equal to one (i.e. where all equilibria are optimal). 
								Our analysis is derived by a combination of distinct tools: optimization theory (regret analysis), dynamical systems (chaos theory) and game theory (equilibria, Price of Anarchy).
								<br>

								He received his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University. 
								He has held research positions at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GaTech, ECE Dept.) and California Institute of Technology (Caltech, Dept. of Computing and Mathematical Sciences) as well as a visiting professor position at UC Berkeley. 
								He is the recipient of a Singapore NRF Fellowship (2018) and a Simons/UC Berkeley Fellowship (2015). 
								His work has been recognized with several distinctions including the outstanding paper award at AAAI (2021) and best paper runner-up at AAMAS (2019, 2022).
