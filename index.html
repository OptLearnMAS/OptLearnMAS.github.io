            </header>
            <p>
              Stimulated by various emerging applications involving agents to solve complex problems in
              real-world domains, such as intelligent sensing systems for the Internet of Things (IoT),
              automated configurators for critical infrastructure networks, and intelligent resource allocation for
              social domains (e.g., security games for the deployment of security resources or
              auctions/procurements for allocating goods and services), agents in these domains commonly
              leverage different forms of optimization and/or learning to solve complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of the workshop is to provide researchers with a venue to discuss models or techniques for
              tackling a variety of multi-agent optimization problems. We seek contributions in the general area of
              multi-agent optimization, including distributed optimization, coalition formation, optimization
              under uncertainty, winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements, and algorithms
              to compute Nash and other equilibria in games. Of particular emphasis are contributions at the
              intersection of optimization and learning.
              See below for a (non-exhaustive) list of topics.
            </p>
            <p>
              This workshop invites works from different strands of the multi-agent systems community that
              pertain to the design of algorithms, models, and techniques to deal with multi-agent optimization
              and learning problems or problems that can be effectively solved by adopting a multi-agent
              framework.
            </p>
            <h3>Topics</h3>
            The workshop organizers invite paper submissions on the following (and related) topics:
            <ul>
              <li>Optimization for learning (strategic and non-strategic) agents</li>
              <li>Learning for multi-agent optimization problems</li>
              <li>Distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization</li>
              <li>Winner determination algorithms in auctions and procurements</li>
              <li>Coalition or group formation algorithms</li>
              <li>Algorithms to compute Nash and other equilibria in games</li>
              <li>Optimization under uncertainty</li>
              <li>Optimization with incomplete or dynamic input data</li>
              <li>Algorithms for real-time applications</li>
              <li>Cloud, distributed and grid computing</li>
              <li>Applications of learning and optimization in societally beneficial domains</li>
              <li>Multi-agent planning</li>
              <li>Multi-robot coordination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The workshop is of interest both to researchers investigating applications of multi-agent systems to optimization problems in large, 
              complex domains, as well as to those examining optimization and learning problems that arise in systems comprised of many autonomous 
              agents. This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to discuss common issues that arise in solving optimization
              and learning problems in different areas, introduce new application domains for multi-agent optimization techniques, and elaborate 
              common benchmarks to test solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of benchmarks and data sets 
              that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in 
              machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
            </p>
            <h3>Format</h3> 
            <p>
              The workshop will be a one-day meeting. It will include several technical sessions, a poster session
              where presenters can discuss their work, with the aim of further fostering collaborations, multiple invited 
              speakers covering crucial challenges in the field of multiagent optimization and learning.
            </p>
            <h3>Attendance</h3>
            <p>
              Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

                  <p><span class="name">Lirong Xia</span> (Rutgers University): <strong>A Linear Theory of Voting</strong><br>
                  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                  Voting mechanisms form the cornerstone of collective decision-making across numerous domains—from political
                  elections and recommender systems to multi-agent systems, and more recently to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
                  The traditional expert-driven paradigm of voting system design involves formulating desiderata (often called axioms),
                  then designing and evaluating rules accordingly.
                  However, this approach can be inefficient due to the complexity of modern applications with diverse stakeholders,
                  as no single voting rule or axiom applies to all applications. Can AI and ML help?
                  This talk introduces a linear theory for AI/ML-augmented design and analysis of voting systems.
                  We demonstrate that many established voting rules and axioms exhibit linear properties, enabling systematic enhancement through machine learning.
                  Our framework introduces general tools that advance both design and analysis within this linear paradigm.
                  For design purposes, we precisely characterize the sample complexity of learning several popular classes of linear rules and axioms.
                  For analytical purposes, we propose a semi-random model paired with a polyhedral approach that transcends worst-case analysis,
                  offering more nuanced evaluation of axiomatic satisfaction.
                  We hope that this linear theory is a useful advancement toward more effective human-AI collaboration
                  in voting system design—potentially transforming how we develop collective decision mechanisms for increasingly complex applications.<br>

                  Marc Lanctot is a research scientist at Google DeepMind.
                  His research interests include multiagent reinforcement learning, computational game theory, multiagent systems, and game-tree search.
                  In the past few years, Marc has investigated game-theoretic approaches to multiagent reinforcement
                  learning with applications to fully and partially observable zero-sum games, sequential social dilemmas, and negotiation/communication games.
                  Most recently, Marc has been working on principled evaluation of general agents using social choice theory and game theory.
                  Marc received a Ph.D. degree in artificial intelligence from the Department of Computer Science, University of Alberta in 2013.
                  Before joining DeepMind, Marc completed a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Department of Knowledge Engineering,
                  Maastricht University, in Maastricht, The Netherlands on Monte Carlo tree search methods in games.
